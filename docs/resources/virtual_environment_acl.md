# Resource: proxmox_virtual_environment_acl

Manages ACLs on the Proxmox cluster.

ACLs are used to control access to resources in the Proxmox cluster.
Each ACL consists of a path, a user, group or token, a role, and a flag to allow propagation of permissions.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "proxmox_virtual_environment_user" "operations_automation" {
  comment  = "Managed by Terraform"
  password = "a-strong-password"
  user_id  = "operations-automation@pve"
}

resource "proxmox_virtual_environment_role" "operations_monitoring" {
  role_id = "operations-monitoring"

  privileges = [
    "VM.Monitor",
  ]
}

resource "proxmox_virtual_environment_acl" "operations_automation_monitoring" {
  user_id = proxmox_virtual_environment_user.operations_automation.user_id
  role_id = proxmox_virtual_environment_role.operations_monitoring.role_id

  path      = "/vms/1234"
  propagate = true
}
```

Clone a VM from a source template/VM and manage only explicitly-defined configuration.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `clone` (Attributes) Clone settings. Changes require recreation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--clone))
- `node_name` (String) Target node for the cloned VM.

### Optional

- `cdrom` (Attributes Map) The CD-ROM configuration. The key is the interface of the CD-ROM, could be one of `ideN`, `sataN`, `scsiN`, where N is the index of the interface. Note that `q35` machine type only supports `ide0` and `ide2` of IDE interfaces. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cdrom))
- `cpu` (Attributes) The CPU configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cpu))
- `delete` (Attributes) Explicit deletions to perform after cloning/updating. Entries persist across applies. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--delete))
- `delete_unreferenced_disks_on_destroy` (Boolean) Delete unreferenced disks on destroy.
- `description` (String) Optional VM description applied after cloning.
- `disk` (Attributes Map) Disks keyed by slot (scsi0, virtio0, sata0, ide0, ...). Only listed keys are managed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--disk))
- `id` (Number) The VM identifier in the Proxmox cluster.
- `name` (String) Optional VM name override applied after cloning.
- `network` (Attributes Map) Network devices keyed by slot (net0, net1, ...). Only listed keys are managed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--network))
- `purge_on_destroy` (Boolean) Purge backup configuration on destroy.
- `rng` (Attributes) Configure the RNG (Random Number Generator) device. The RNG device provides entropy to guests to ensure good quality random numbers for guest applications that require them. Can only be set by `root@pam.`See the [Proxmox documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html#qm_virtual_machines_settings) for more information. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rng))
- `stop_on_destroy` (Boolean) Stop the VM on destroy (instead of shutdown).
- `tags` (Set of String) Tags applied after cloning.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))
- `vga` (Attributes) Configure the VGA Hardware. If you want to use high resolution modes (>= 1280x1024x16) you may need to increase the vga memory option. Since QEMU 2.9 the default VGA display type is `std` for all OS types besides some Windows versions (XP and older) which use `cirrus`. The `qxl` option enables the SPICE display server. For win* OS you can select how many independent displays you want, Linux guests can add displays themself. You can also run without any graphic card, using a serial device as terminal. See the [Proxmox documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html#qm_virtual_machines_settings) section 10.2.8 for more information and available configuration parameters. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--vga))

<a id="nestedatt--cdrom"></a>
### Nested Schema for `cdrom`

Optional:

- `file_id` (String) The file ID of the CD-ROM, or `cdrom|none`. Defaults to `none` to leave the CD-ROM empty. Use `cdrom` to connect to the physical drive.


<a id="nestedatt--cpu"></a>
### Nested Schema for `cpu`

Optional:

- `affinity` (String) The CPU cores that are used to run the VM’s vCPU. The value is a list of CPU IDs, separated by commas. The CPU IDs are zero-based.  For example, `0,1,2,3` (which also can be shortened to `0-3`) means that the VM’s vCPUs are run on the first four CPU cores. Setting `affinity` is only allowed for `root@pam` authenticated user.
- `architecture` (String) The CPU architecture `<aarch64 | x86_64>` (defaults to the host). Setting `affinity` is only allowed for `root@pam` authenticated user.
- `cores` (Number) The number of CPU cores per socket (defaults to `1`).
- `flags` (Set of String) Set of additional CPU flags. Use `+FLAG` to enable, `-FLAG` to disable a flag. Custom CPU models can specify any flag supported by QEMU/KVM, VM-specific flags must be from the following set for security reasons: `pcid`, `spec-ctrl`, `ibpb`, `ssbd`, `virt-ssbd`, `amd-ssbd`, `amd-no-ssb`, `pdpe1gb`, `md-clear`, `hv-tlbflush`, `hv-evmcs`, `aes`.
- `hotplugged` (Number) The number of hotplugged vCPUs (defaults to `0`).
- `limit` (Number) Limit of CPU usage (defaults to `0` which means no limit).
- `numa` (Boolean) Enable NUMA (defaults to `false`).
- `sockets` (Number) The number of CPU sockets (defaults to `1`).
- `type` (String) Emulated CPU type, it's recommended to use `x86-64-v2-AES` or higher (defaults to `kvm64`). See https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html#qm_virtual_machines_settings for more information.
- `units` (Number) CPU weight for a VM. Argument is used in the kernel fair scheduler. The larger the number is, the more CPU time this VM gets. Number is relative to weights of all the other running VMs.

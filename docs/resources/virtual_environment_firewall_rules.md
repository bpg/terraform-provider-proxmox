# Resource: proxmox_virtual_environment_firewall_rules

A security group is a collection of rules, defined at cluster level, which can
be used in all VMs' rules. For example, you can define a group named “webserver”
with rules to open the http and https ports. Rules can be created on the cluster
level, on VM / Container level.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "proxmox_virtual_environment_firewall_rules" "inbound" {
  depends_on = [
    proxmox_virtual_environment_vm.example,
    proxmox_virtual_environment_cluster_firewall_security_group.example,
  ]

  node_name = proxmox_virtual_environment_vm.example.node_name
  vm_id     = proxmox_virtual_environment_vm.example.vm_id

  rule {
    type    = "in"
    action  = "ACCEPT"
    comment = "Allow HTTP"
    dest    = "192.168.1.5"
    dport   = "80"
    proto   = "tcp"
    log     = "info"
  }

  rule {
    type    = "in"
    action  = "ACCEPT"
    comment = "Allow HTTPS"
    dest    = "192.168.1.5"
    dport   = "443"
    proto   = "tcp"
    log     = "info"
  }

  rule {
    security_group = proxmox_virtual_environment_cluster_firewall_security_group.example.name
    comment        = "From security group"
    iface          = "net0"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

- `node_name` - (Optional) Node name. Leave empty for cluster level rules.
- `vm_id` - (Optional) VM ID. Leave empty for cluster level rules.
- `container_id` - (Optional) Container ID. Leave empty for cluster level
  rules.
- `rule` - (Optional) Firewall rule block (multiple blocks supported).
  The provider supports two types of the `rule` blocks:
  - a rule definition block, which includes the following arguments:
    - `action` - (Required) Rule action (`ACCEPT`, `DROP`, `REJECT`).
    - `type` - (Required) Rule type (`in`, `out`).
    - `comment` - (Optional) Rule comment.
    - `dest` - (Optional) Restrict packet destination address. This can
          refer to a single IP address, an IP set ('+ipsetname') or an IP alias
          definition. You can also specify an address range
          like `20.34.101.207-201.3.9.99`, or a list of IP addresses and
          networks (entries are separated by comma). Please do not mix IPv4 and
          IPv6 addresses inside such lists.
    - `dport` - (Optional) Restrict TCP/UDP destination port. You can use
          service names or simple numbers (0-65535), as defined
          in `/etc/services`. Port ranges can be specified with '\d+:\d+', for
          example `80:85`, and you can use comma separated list to match several
          ports or ranges.
    - `enabled` - (Optional) Enable this rule. Defaults to `true`.
    - `iface` - (Optional) Network interface name. You have to use network
          configuration key names for VMs and containers ('net\d+'). Host
          related rules can use arbitrary strings.
    - `log` - (Optional) Log level for this rule (`emerg`, `alert`, `crit`,
          `err`, `warning`, `notice`, `info`, `debug`, `nolog`).
    - `macro`- (Optional) Macro name. Use predefined standard macro
          from <https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html#_firewall_macro_definitions>
    - `proto` - (Optional) Restrict packet protocol. You can use protocol
          names as defined in '/etc/protocols'.
    - `source` - (Optional) Restrict packet source address. This can refer
          to a single IP address, an IP set ('+ipsetname') or an IP alias
          definition. You can also specify an address range
          like `20.34.101.207-201.3.9.99`, or a list of IP addresses and
          networks (entries are separated by comma). Please do not mix IPv4 and
          IPv6 addresses inside such lists.
    - `sport` - (Optional) Restrict TCP/UDP source port. You can use
          service names or simple numbers (0-65535), as defined
          in `/etc/services`. Port ranges can be specified with '\d+:\d+', for
          example `80:85`, and you can use comma separated list to match several
          ports or ranges.
  - a security group insertion block, which includes the following arguments:
    - `comment` - (Optional) Rule comment.
    - `enabled` - (Optional) Enable this rule. Defaults to `true`.
    - `iface` - (Optional) Network interface name. You have to use network
          configuration key names for VMs and containers ('net\d+'). Host
          related rules can use arbitrary strings.
    - `security_group` - (Required) Security group name.

## Attribute Reference

- `rule`
  - `pos` - Position of the rule in the list.

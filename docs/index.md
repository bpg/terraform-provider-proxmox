# Proxmox Provider

This provider for [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is used for interacting with resources supported by [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/).
The provider needs to be configured with the proper endpoints and credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint = "https://10.0.0.2:8006/"
  # TODO: use terraform variable or remove the line, and use PROXMOX_VE_USERNAME environment variable
  username = "root@pam"
  # TODO: use terraform variable or remove the line, and use PROXMOX_VE_PASSWORD environment variable
  password = "the-password-set-during-installation-of-proxmox-ve"
  # because self-signed TLS certificate is in use
  insecure = true
  # uncomment (unless on Windows...)
  # tmp_dir  = "/var/tmp"

  ssh {
    agent = true
    # TODO: uncomment and configure if using api_token instead of password
    # username = "root"
  }
}
```

## Authentication

The Proxmox provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication.
Static credentials can be provided to the `proxmox` block through either a `api_token` or a combination of `username` and `password` arguments.

!> Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not recommended, and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a public version control system.

Static credentials can be provided by adding a `username` and `password`, or `api_token` in-line in the Proxmox provider block:

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint = "https://10.0.0.2:8006/"
  username = "username@realm"
  password = "a-strong-password"
}
```

A better approach is to extract these values into Terraform variables, and reference the variables instead:

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint = var.virtual_environment_endpoint
  username = var.virtual_environment_username
  password = var.virtual_environment_password
}
```

The variable values can be provided via a separate `.tfvars` file that should be gitignored.
See the [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html) for more information.

### Environment variables

Instead of using static arguments, credentials can be handled through the use of environment variables.
For example:

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint = "https://10.0.0.2:8006/"
}
```

```sh
export PROXMOX_VE_USERNAME="username@realm"
export PROXMOX_VE_PASSWORD="a-strong-password"
terraform plan
```

See the [Argument Reference](#argument-reference) section for the supported variable names and use cases.

## SSH Connection

~> Please read if you are using VMs with custom disk images, or uploading snippets.

The Proxmox provider can connect to a Proxmox node via SSH.
This is used in the `proxmox_virtual_environment_vm` or `proxmox_virtual_environment_file` resource to execute commands on the node to perform actions that are not supported by Proxmox API.
For example, to import VM disks, or to uploading certain type of resources, such as snippets.

The SSH connection configuration is provided via the optional `ssh` block in the `provider` block:

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint = "https://10.0.0.2:8006/"
  username = "username@realm"
  password = "a-strong-password"
  insecure = true

  ssh {
    agent = true
  }
}
```

If no `ssh` block is provided, the provider will attempt to connect to the target node using the credentials provided in the `username` and `password` arguments (or `PROXMOX_VE_USERNAME` and `PROXMOX_VE_PASSWORD` environment variables).
Note that the target node is identified by the `node` argument in the resource, and may be different from the Proxmox API endpoint.
Please refer to the [Argument Reference](#argument-reference) section to view the available arguments of the `ssh` block.

### SSH Agent

The provider does not use OS-specific SSH configuration files, such as `~/.ssh/config`.
Instead, it uses the SSH protocol directly, and supports the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable (or `agent_socket` argument) to connect to the `ssh-agent`.
This allows the provider to use the SSH agent configured by the user, and to support multiple SSH agents running on the same machine.
You can find more details on the SSH Agent [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ssh-essentials-working-with-ssh-servers-clients-and-keys#adding-your-ssh-keys-to-an-ssh-agent-to-avoid-typing-the-passphrase).
The SSH agent authentication takes precedence over the `private_key` and `password` authentication.

-> By default on Windows, the provider will assume the SSH agent is at `\\.\pipe\openssh-ssh-agent`.

### SSH Private Key

In some cases where SSH agent is not available, for example when using a CI/CD pipeline that does not support SSH agent forwarding, 
you can use the `private_key` argument in the `ssh` block (or alternatively `PROXMOX_VE_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable) to provide the private key for the SSH connection.

The private key mut not be encrypted, and must be in PEM format.

You can provide the private key from a file:
```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  // ...
  ssh {
    agent       = false
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
  }
}
```

Alternatively, although not recommended due to the increased risk of exposing an unprotected key, heredoc syntax can be used to supply the private key as a string.
Note that the content of the private key is injected using `<<-` format to ignore indentation:
```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  // ...

  ssh {
    agent       = false
    private_key = <<-EOF
    -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
    b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAAAMwAAAAtzc2gtZW
    <SKIPPED>
    DMUWUEaH7yMCKl7uCZ9xAAAAAAECAwQF
    -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
    EOF
  }
}
```

### SSH User

By default, the provider will use the same username for the SSH connection as the one used for the Proxmox API connection (when using PAM authentication).
This can be overridden by specifying the `username` argument in the `ssh` block (or alternatively a username in the `PROXMOX_VE_SSH_USERNAME` environment variable):

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  // ...

  ssh {
    agent    = true
    username = "terraform"
  }
}
```

-> When using API Token or non-PAM authentication for Proxmox API, the `username` field in the `ssh` block (or alternatively a username in `PROXMOX_VE_USERNAME` or `PROXMOX_VE_SSH_USERNAME` environment variable) is **required**.
This is because the provider needs to know which PAM user to use for the SSH connection.

When using a non-root user for the SSH connection, the user **must** have the `sudo` privilege on the target node without requiring a password.

-> If you run clustered Proxmox VE, you will need to configure the `sudo` privilege for the user on all nodes in the cluster.

-> `sudo` is not installed by default on Proxmox VE nodes. You can install it via the command line on the Proxmox host: `apt install sudo`

You can configure the `sudo` privilege for the user via the command line on the Proxmox host. In the example below, we create a user `terraform` and assign the `sudo` privilege to it:

- Create a new system user:

    ```sh
    sudo useradd -m terraform
    ```

- Configure the `sudo` privilege for the user:

    ```sh
    sudo visudo
    ```

  Add the following lines to the end of the file:

    ```sh
    terraform ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/pvesm
    terraform ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/qm
    terraform ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /var/lib/vz/*
    ```

  Save the file and exit.

- Copy your SSH public key to the new user on the target node:

    ```sh
    ssh-copy-id terraform@<target-node>
    ```

    or manually add your public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file of the `terraform` user on the target node.

- Test the SSH connection and password-less `sudo`:
  
    ```sh
    ssh terraform@<target-node> sudo pvesm apiinfo 
    ```

  You should be able to connect to the target node and see the output containing `APIVER <number>` on the screen without being prompted for your password.

### Node IP address used for SSH connection

In order to make the SSH connection, the provider needs to be able to resolve the target node name to an IP.
The following methods are used to resolve the node name, in the specified order:

1. Enumerate the node's network interfaces via the Proxmox API, and identify the first interface that:
   1. Has an IPv4 address with IPv4 gateway configured, or
   2. Has an IPv6 address with IPv6 gateway configured, or
   3. Has an IPv4 address
2. Resolve the Proxmox node name (usually a shortname) via DNS using the system DNS resolver of the machine running Terraform.

In some cases this may not be the desired behavior, for example, when the node has multiple network interfaces, and the one that should be used for SSH is not the first one.

To override the node IP address used for SSH connection, you can use the optional `node` blocks in the `ssh` block, and specify the desired IP address (or FQDN) for each node.
For example:

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  // ...
  ssh {
    // ...
    node {
      name    = "pve1"
      address = "192.168.10.1"
    }
    node {
      name    = "pve2"
      address = "192.168.10.2"
    }
  }
}
```

### SSH Connection via SOCKS5 Proxy

The provider supports SSH connection to the target node via a SOCKS5 proxy.

To enable the SOCKS5 proxy, you need to configure the `ssh` block in the `provider` block, and specify the `socks5_server` argument:

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  // ...
  ssh {
    // ...
    socks5_server     = "ip-or-fqdn-of-socks5-server:port"
    socks5_username   = "username"  # optional  
    socks5_password   = "password"  # optional
  }
}
```

If enabled, this method will be used for all SSH connections to the target nodes in the cluster. 

## API Token Authentication

API Token authentication can be used to authenticate with the Proxmox API without the need to provide a password.
In combination with the `ssh` block and `ssh-agent` support, this allows for a fully password-less authentication.

You can create an API Token for a user via the Proxmox UI, or via the command line on the Proxmox host or cluster:

- Create a user:

    ```sh
    sudo pveum user add terraform@pve
    ```

- Create a role for the user (you can skip this step if you want to use the any of the existing roles):

    ```sh
    sudo pveum role add Terraform -privs "Datastore.Allocate Datastore.AllocateSpace Datastore.AllocateTemplate Datastore.Audit Pool.Allocate Sys.Audit Sys.Console Sys.Modify SDN.Use VM.Allocate VM.Audit VM.Clone VM.Config.CDROM VM.Config.Cloudinit VM.Config.CPU VM.Config.Disk VM.Config.HWType VM.Config.Memory VM.Config.Network VM.Config.Options VM.Migrate VM.Monitor VM.PowerMgmt User.Modify"
    ```

  ~> The list of privileges above is only an example, please review it and adjust to your needs.
  Refer to the [privileges documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pveum.1.html#_privileges) for more details.

- Assign the role to the previously created user:

    ```sh
    sudo pveum aclmod / -user terraform@pve -role Terraform
    ```

- Create an API token for the user:

    ```sh
    sudo pveum user token add terraform@pve provider --privsep=0
    ```

Refer to the upstream docs as needed for additional details concerning [PVE User Management](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/User_Management).

Generating the token will output a table containing the token's ID and secret which are meant to be concatenated into a single string for use with either the `api_token` field of the `provider` block (fine for testing but should be avoided) or sourced from the `PROXMOX_VE_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint  = var.virtual_environment_endpoint
  api_token = "terraform@pve!provider=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  insecure  = true
  ssh {
    agent    = true
    username = "terraform"
  }
}
```

-> The token authentication is taking precedence over the password authentication.

-> Not all Proxmox API operations are supported via API Token.
You may see errors like `error creating container: received an HTTP 403 response - Reason: Permission check failed (changing feature flags for privileged container is only allowed for root@pam)` or `error creating VM: received an HTTP 500 response - Reason: only root can set 'arch' config` when using API Token authentication, even when `Administrator` role or the `root@pam` user is used with the token.
The workaround is to use password authentication for those operations.

-> You can also configure additional Proxmox users and roles using [`virtual_environment_user`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bpg/proxmox/latest/docs/data-sources/virtual_environment_user) and [`virtual_environment_role`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bpg/proxmox/latest/docs/data-sources/virtual_environment_role) resources of the provider.

## Temporary Directory

Using `proxmox_virtual_environment_file` with `.iso` files or disk images can require large amount of space in the temporary directory of the computer running terraform.

Consider pointing `tmp_dir` to a directory with enough space, especially if the default temporary directory is limited by the system memory (e.g. `tmpfs` mounted on `/tmp`).

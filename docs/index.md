# Proxmox Provider

This provider for [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) / [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) is used for interacting with resources supported by [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview).
The provider needs to be configured with the proper endpoints and credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint = "https://10.0.0.2:8006/"

  # TODO: use terraform variable or remove the line, and use PROXMOX_VE_USERNAME environment variable
  username = "root@pam"
  # TODO: use terraform variable or remove the line, and use PROXMOX_VE_PASSWORD environment variable
  password = "the-password-set-during-installation-of-proxmox-ve"

  # because self-signed TLS certificate is in use
  insecure = true
  # uncomment (unless on Windows...)
  # tmp_dir  = "/var/tmp"

  ssh {
    agent = true
    # TODO: uncomment and configure if using api_token instead of password
    # username = "root"
  }
}
```

## Authentication

The Proxmox provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication.
Static credentials and pre-authenticated session-ticket can be provided to the `proxmox` block through one the choices of arguments below, ordered by precedence:

- `api_token`
- `auth_ticket` and `csrf_prevention_token`
- `username` and `password`

!> Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not recommended, and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a public version control system.

### Static Credentials Examples

Credentials can be provided in-line in the Proxmox provider block. Here are examples for each authentication method:

**API Token (Recommended for Production):**

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint  = "https://10.0.0.2:8006/"
  api_token = "terraform@pve!provider=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

**Username/Password (Development/Testing):**

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint = "https://10.0.0.2:8006/"
  insecure = true
  username = "username@realm"
  password = "a-strong-password"
}
```

**Auth Ticket (Automated Scripts):**

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint              = "https://10.0.0.2:8006/"
  auth_ticket          = "PVE:username@realm:12345678::some_base64_payload=="
  csrf_prevention_token = "12345678:some_blob"
}
```

A better approach is to extract these values into Terraform variables, and reference the variables instead:

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint = var.virtual_environment_endpoint
  
  # Choose one authentication method:
  api_token = var.virtual_environment_api_token
  # OR
  username  = var.virtual_environment_username
  password  = var.virtual_environment_password
  # OR
  auth_ticket           = var.virtual_environment_auth_ticket
  csrf_prevention_token = var.virtual_environment_csrf_prevention_token
}
```

The variable values can be provided via a separate `.tfvars` file that should be gitignored.
See the [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html) for more information.

### Security Best Practices

1. **API Token Usage:**
   - Use API tokens in production environments
   - Create tokens with minimal required permissions
   - Rotate tokens periodically

2. **Password Authentication:**
   - Limit to development/testing environments
   - Never commit passwords to version control
   - Use strong passwords
   - Change passwords regularly

3. **Auth Ticket:**
   - Implement proper token renewal mechanism
   - Store tickets securely
   - Use TOTP when available

4. **General:**
   - Use HTTPS with valid certificates
   - Only set `insecure = true` in development
   - Use separate credentials for different environments
   - Implement proper secret rotation

### Environment variables

Instead of using static arguments, credentials can be handled through the use of environment variables.
For example:

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint = "https://10.0.0.2:8006/"
}
```

```sh
export PROXMOX_VE_USERNAME="username@realm"
export PROXMOX_VE_PASSWORD='a-strong-password'
terraform plan
```

See the [Argument Reference](#argument-reference) section for the supported variable names and use cases.

### API Token Authentication

API Token authentication can be used to authenticate with the Proxmox API without the need to provide a password.
In combination with the `ssh` block and `ssh-agent` support, this allows for a fully password-less authentication.

You can create an API Token for a user via the Proxmox UI, or via the command line on the Proxmox host or cluster:

- Create a user:

    ```sh
    sudo pveum user add terraform@pve
    ```

- Create a role for the user (you can skip this step if you want to use any of the existing roles):

    ```sh
    sudo pveum role add Terraform -privs "Datastore.Allocate Datastore.AllocateSpace Datastore.AllocateTemplate Datastore.Audit Pool.Allocate Sys.Audit Sys.Console Sys.Modify SDN.Use VM.Allocate VM.Audit VM.Clone VM.Config.CDROM VM.Config.Cloudinit VM.Config.CPU VM.Config.Disk VM.Config.HWType VM.Config.Memory VM.Config.Network VM.Config.Options VM.Migrate VM.Monitor VM.PowerMgmt User.Modify"
    ```

  ~> The list of privileges above is only an example, please review it and adjust to your needs.
  Refer to the [privileges documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pveum.1.html#_privileges) for more details.

- Assign the role to the previously created user:

    ```sh
    sudo pveum aclmod / -user terraform@pve -role Terraform
    ```

- Create an API token for the user:

    ```sh
    sudo pveum user token add terraform@pve provider --privsep=0
    ```

Refer to the upstream docs as needed for additional details concerning [PVE User Management](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/User_Management).

Generating the token will output a table containing the token's ID and secret which are meant to be concatenated into a single string for use with either the `api_token` field of the `provider` block (fine for testing but should be avoided) or sourced from the `PROXMOX_VE_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint  = var.virtual_environment_endpoint
  api_token = "terraform@pve!provider=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  insecure  = true
  ssh {
    agent    = true
    username = "terraform"
  }
}
```

-> Not all Proxmox API operations are supported via API Token.
You may see errors like
`error creating container: received an HTTP 403 response - Reason: Permission check failed (changing feature flags for privileged container is only allowed for root@pam)` or
`error creating VM: received an HTTP 500 response - Reason: only root can set 'arch' config` or
`Permission check failed (user != root@pam)` when using API Token authentication, even when `Administrator` role or the `root@pam` user is used with the token.
The workaround is to use password authentication for those operations.

-> You can also configure additional Proxmox users and roles using [`virtual_environment_user`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bpg/proxmox/latest/docs/data-sources/virtual_environment_user) and [`virtual_environment_role`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bpg/proxmox/latest/docs/data-sources/virtual_environment_role) resources of the provider.

### Pre-Authentication, or Passing an Authentication Ticket into the provider

It is possible to generate a session ticket with the API, and to pass the ticket and csrf_prevention_token into the provider using environment variables `PROXMOX_VE_AUTH_TICKET` and `PROXMOX_VE_CSRF_PREVENTION_TOKEN` (or provider's arguments `auth_ticket` and `csrf_prevention_token`). See more details in the [Proxmox Wiki](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Proxmox_VE_API#Ticket_Cookie).

An example of using `curl` and `jq` to query the Proxmox API to get a Proxmox session ticket; it is also very easy to pass in a TOTP password this way:

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint = "https://10.0.0.2:8006/"
}
```

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

## assume vars are set: PROXMOX_VE_ENDPOINT, PROXMOX_VE_USERNAME, PROXMOX_VE_PASSWORD
## end-goal: automatically set PROXMOX_VE_AUTH_TICKET and PROXMOX_VE_CSRF_PREVENTION_TOKEN

_user_totp_password='123456' ## optional TOTP password


proxmox_api_ticket_path='api2/json/access/ticket' ## cannot have double "//" - ensure endpoint ends with a "/" and this string does not begin with a "/", or vice-versa

## call the auth api endpoint
resp=$( curl -q -s -k --data-urlencode "username=${PROXMOX_VE_USERNAME}"  --data-urlencode "password=${PROXMOX_VE_PASSWORD}"  "${PROXMOX_VE_ENDPOINT}${proxmox_api_ticket_path}" )
auth_ticket=$( jq -r '.data.ticket' <<<"${resp}" )
resp_csrf=$( jq -r '.data.CSRFPreventionToken' <<<"${resp}" )

## check if the response payload needs a TFA (totp) passed, call the auth-api endpoint again
if [[ $(jq -r '.data.NeedTFA' <<<"${resp}") == 1 ]]; then
  resp=$( curl -q -s -k  -H "CSRFPreventionToken: ${resp_csrf}" --data-urlencode  "username=${PROXMOX_VE_USERNAME}" --data-urlencode "tfa-challenge=${auth_ticket}" --data-urlencode "password=totp:${_user_totp_password}"  "${PROXMOX_VE_ENDPOINT}${proxmox_api_ticket_path}" )
  auth_ticket=$( jq -r '.data.ticket' <<<"${resp}" )
  resp_csrf=$( jq -r '.data.CSRFPreventionToken' <<<"${resp}" )
fi


export PROXMOX_VE_AUTH_TICKET="${auth_ticket}"
export PROXMOX_VE_CSRF_PREVENTION_TOKEN="${resp_csrf}"

terraform plan
```

## SSH Connection

~> Please read if you are using VMs with custom disk images, or uploading snippets.

The Proxmox provider can connect to a Proxmox node via SSH.
This is used in the `proxmox_virtual_environment_vm` or `proxmox_virtual_environment_file` resource to execute commands on the node to perform actions that are not supported by Proxmox API.
For example, to import VM disks, or to uploading certain type of resources, such as snippets.

The SSH connection configuration is provided via the optional `ssh` block in the `provider` block:

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint = "https://10.0.0.2:8006/"
  username = "username@realm"
  password = "a-strong-password"
  insecure = true

  ssh {
    agent = true
  }
}
```

If no `ssh` block is provided, the provider will attempt to connect to the target node using the credentials provided in the `username` and `password` arguments (or `PROXMOX_VE_USERNAME` and `PROXMOX_VE_PASSWORD` environment variables).
Note that the target node is identified by the `node` argument in the resource, and may be different from the Proxmox API endpoint.
Please refer to the [Argument Reference](#argument-reference) section to view the available arguments of the `ssh` block.

### SSH Agent

The provider does not use OS-specific SSH configuration files, such as `~/.ssh/config`.
Instead, it uses the SSH protocol directly, and supports the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable (or `agent_socket` argument) to connect to the `ssh-agent`.
This allows the provider to use the SSH agent configured by the user, and to support multiple SSH agents running on the same machine.
You can find more details on the SSH Agent [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ssh-essentials-working-with-ssh-servers-clients-and-keys#adding-your-ssh-keys-to-an-ssh-agent-to-avoid-typing-the-passphrase).
The SSH agent authentication takes precedence over the `private_key` and `password` authentication.

-> By default on Windows, the provider will assume the SSH agent is at `\\.\pipe\openssh-ssh-agent`.

### SSH Private Key

In some cases where SSH agent is not available, for example when using a CI/CD pipeline that does not support SSH agent forwarding,
you can use the `private_key` argument in the `ssh` block (or alternatively `PROXMOX_VE_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable) to provide the private key for the SSH connection.

The private key must not be encrypted, and must be in PEM format.

You can provide the private key from a file:

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  // ...
  ssh {
    agent       = false
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
  }
}
```

Alternatively, although not recommended due to the increased risk of exposing an unprotected key, heredoc syntax can be used to supply the private key as a string.
Note that the content of the private key is injected using `<<-` format to ignore indentation:

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  // ...

  ssh {
    agent       = false
    private_key = <<-EOF
    -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
    b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAAAMwAAAAtzc2gtZW
    <SKIPPED>
    DMUWUEaH7yMCKl7uCZ9xAAAAAAECAwQF
    -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
    EOF
  }
}
```

### SSH User

By default, the provider will use the same username for the SSH connection as the one used for the Proxmox API connection (when using PAM authentication).
This can be overridden by specifying the `username` argument in the `ssh` block (or alternatively a username in the `PROXMOX_VE_SSH_USERNAME` environment variable):

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  // ...

  ssh {
    agent    = true
    username = "terraform"
  }
}
```

-> When using API Token or non-PAM authentication for Proxmox API, the `username` field in the `ssh` block (or alternatively a username in `PROXMOX_VE_USERNAME` or `PROXMOX_VE_SSH_USERNAME` environment variable) is **required**.
This is because the provider needs to know which PAM user to use for the SSH connection.

When using a non-root user for the SSH connection, the user **must** have the `sudo` privilege on the target node without requiring a password.

-> If you run clustered Proxmox VE, you will need to configure the `sudo` privilege for the user on all nodes in the cluster.

-> `sudo` may not be installed by default on Proxmox VE nodes. You can install it via the command line on the Proxmox host: `apt install sudo`

~> The `root` user on the Proxmox node must be configured with `bash` as the default shell.

You can configure the `sudo` privilege for the user via the command line on the Proxmox host.
In the example below, we create a user `terraform` and assign the `sudo` privilege to it. Run the following commands on the Proxmox node in the root shell:

- Create a new system user:

    ```sh
    useradd -m terraform
    ```

- Configure the `sudo` privilege for the user, by adding a new sudoers file to the `/etc/sudoers.d` directory:

    ```sh
    visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/terraform
    ```

  Add the following lines to the file:

    ```text
    terraform ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/pvesm
    terraform ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/qm
    terraform ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /var/lib/vz/*
    ```

  If you're using a different datastore for snippets, not the default `local`, you should add the datastore's mount point to the sudoers file as well, for example:
  
    ```text
    terraform ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /mnt/pve/cephfs/*
    ```

  You can find the mount point of the datastore by running `pvesh get /storage/<name>` on the Proxmox node.

- Copy your SSH public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file of the `terraform` user on the target node.

- Test the SSH connection and password-less `sudo`:
  
    ```sh
    ssh terraform@<target-node> sudo pvesm apiinfo 
    ```

  You should be able to connect to the target node and see the output containing `APIVER <number>` on the screen without being prompted for your password.

### Node IP address used for SSH connection

In order to make the SSH connection, the provider needs to be able to resolve the target node name to an IP.
The following methods are used to resolve the node name, in the specified order:

1. Enumerate the node's network interfaces via the Proxmox API, and identify the first interface that:
   1. Has an IPv4 address with IPv4 gateway configured, or
   2. Has an IPv6 address with IPv6 gateway configured, or
   3. Has an IPv4 address
2. Resolve the Proxmox node name (usually a shortname) via DNS using the system DNS resolver of the machine running Terraform.

In some cases this may not be the desired behavior, for example, when the node has multiple network interfaces, and the one that should be used for SSH is not the first one.

To override the node IP address used for SSH connection, you can use the optional `node` blocks in the `ssh` block, and specify the desired IP address (or FQDN) for each node.
For example:

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  // ...
  ssh {
    // ...
    node {
      name    = "pve1"
      address = "192.168.10.1"
    }
    node {
      name    = "pve2"
      address = "192.168.10.2"
    }
  }
}
```

### SSH Connection via SOCKS5 Proxy

The provider supports SSH connection to the target node via a SOCKS5 proxy.

To enable the SOCKS5 proxy, you need to configure the `ssh` block in the `provider` block, and specify the `socks5_server` argument:

```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  // ...
  ssh {
    // ...
    socks5_server     = "ip-or-fqdn-of-socks5-server:port"
    socks5_username   = "username"  # optional  
    socks5_password   = "password"  # optional
  }
}
```

If enabled, this method will be used for all SSH connections to the target nodes in the cluster.

## VM and Container ID Assignment

When creating VMs and Containers, you can specify the optional `vm_id` attribute to set the ID of the VM or Container. However, the ID is a mandatory attribute in the Proxmox API and must be unique within the cluster. If the `vm_id` attribute is not specified, the provider will generate a unique ID and assign it to the resource.

The Proxmox API provides a helper function to retrieve the "next available" unique ID in the cluster, but there is no option to reserve an ID before a resource is created. Instead, the provider uses a file-based locking technique to reserve retrieved sequential IDs and prevent duplicates. However, conflicts cannot be fully avoided, especially when multiple resources are created simultaneously by different provider instances.

To mitigate this issue, you can set the `random_vm_ids` attribute to `true` in the `provider` block. This will generate a random ID for each VM or Container when the `vm_id` attribute is not specified. The generated ID is checked for uniqueness through the Proxmox API before resource creation, significantly reducing the risk of conflicts.

## Temporary Directory

Using `proxmox_virtual_environment_file` with `.iso` files or disk images can require a large amount of space in the temporary directory of the computer running terraform.

Consider pointing `tmp_dir` to a directory with enough space, especially if the default temporary directory is limited by the system memory (e.g. `tmpfs` mounted on `/tmp`).

A better approach is to use `proxmox_virtual_environment_download_file` resource to download the file directly to the target node, without buffering to the local machine.

## Argument Reference

In addition to [generic provider arguments](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html) ( e.g. `alias` and `version`), the following arguments are supported in the Proxmox `provider` block:

- `endpoint` - (Required) The endpoint for the Proxmox Virtual Environment API (can also be sourced from `PROXMOX_VE_ENDPOINT`). Usually this is `https://<your-cluster-endpoint>:8006/`. **Do not** include `/api2/json` at the end.

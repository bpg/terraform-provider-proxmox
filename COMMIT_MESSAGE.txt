fix(vm): suppress diff when disk blocks are reordered

Add CustomizeDiff function to handle disk block reordering in VM
configurations. When disk blocks are reordered but have identical
content, the provider now suppresses the diff to prevent unnecessary
plan changes.

The fix compares disk blocks by their interface key, ignoring the
computed path_in_datastore field, and clears all disk-related diffs
when the blocks are equal but reordered.

Changes:
- Added CustomizeDiff function in proxmoxtf/resource/vm/disk/schema.go
- Integrated CustomizeDiff into VM resource CustomizeDiff chain
- Added unit test to verify comparison logic
- Added acceptance test to verify fix works end-to-end

# How to contribute

**First:** if you're unsure or afraid of _anything_, ask for help! You can
submit a work in progress (WIP) pull request, or file an issue with the parts
you know. We'll do our best to guide you in the right direction, and let you
know if there are guidelines we will need to follow. We want people to be able
to participate without fear of doing the wrong thing.

Below are our expectations for contributors. Following these guidelines gives us
the best opportunity to work with you, by making sure we have the things we need
in order to make it happen. Doing your best to follow it will speed up our
ability to merge PRs and respond to issues.

## Testing

The project has a handful of test cases which must pass for a contribution to be
accepted. We also expect that you either create new test cases or modify
existing ones in order to target your changes.

You can run all the test cases by invoking `make test`.

## Submitting changes

Please create a new PR against the `master` which must be based on the project's
[pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Coding conventions

We expect that all code contributions have been formatted using `gofmt`.

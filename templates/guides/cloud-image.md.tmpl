# Create a VM from a Cloud Image

## Download a public cloud image from URL

Example of how to create a CentOS 8 VM from a "generic cloud" `qcow2` image. CentOS 8 images are available at [cloud.centos.org](https://cloud.centos.org/centos/8-stream/x86_64/images/):

{{ codefile "terraform" "examples/guides/cloud-image/centos-qcow2/main.tf" }}

Ubuntu cloud images are available at [cloud-images.ubuntu.com](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/). Ubuntu cloud images are in `qcow2` format as well, but stored with `.img` extension, so they can be directly uploaded to Proxmox without renaming.

{{ codefile "terraform" "examples/guides/cloud-image/ubuntu-img/main.tf" }}

## Create a VM from a compressed cloud image

Some distributions, like Fedora CoreOS, only provide cloud images in compressed formats (e.g., `.qcow2.xz`). Proxmox does not directly support XZ-compressed images, but its ZST decompression can handle XZ archives.

~> **Important:** Compressed images cannot be used with `import_from`. You must use `file_id` with `content_type = "iso"` instead. This requires SSH configuration in the provider.

Example of how to create a Fedora CoreOS VM from an XZ-compressed `qcow2` image. CoreOS images are available at [fedoraproject.org/coreos](https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/download):

{{ codefile "terraform" "examples/guides/cloud-image/coreos-xz/main.tf" }}

## Create a VM from an existing image on Proxmox

If you already have a cloud image on Proxmox, you can use it to create a VM:

{{ codefile "terraform" "examples/guides/cloud-image/debian-from-storage/main.tf" }}

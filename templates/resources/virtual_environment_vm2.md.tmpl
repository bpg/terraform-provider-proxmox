-> Note: Many attributes are marked as **optional** _and_ **computed** in the schema,
hence you may seem added to the plan with "(known after apply)" status, even if they are not set in the configuration.
This is done to support the `clone` operation, when a VM is created from an existing one,
and attributes of the original VM are copied to the new one.

Computed attributes allow the provider to set those attributes without user input.
The attributes are marked as optional to allow the user to set (or overwrite) them if needed.
In order to remove the computed attribute from the plan, you can set it to an empty value (e.g. `""` for string, `[]` for collection).

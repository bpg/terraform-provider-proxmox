-> Many attributes are marked as **optional** _and_ **computed** in the schema,
hence you may seem added to the plan with "(known after apply)" status, even if they are not set in the configuration.
This is done to support the `clone` operation, when a VM is created from an existing VM or template,
and the source attributes are copied to the clone.<br><br>
Computed attributes allow the provider to set those attributes without user input.
The attributes are also marked as optional to allow the practitioner to set (or overwrite) them if needed.

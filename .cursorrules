# Cursor Rules - Terraform Provider Proxmox

## Primary Instructions

**Read and follow [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** — This is the canonical source for project guidelines, development workflow, and code patterns.

## Cursor-Specific Behavior

### Memory Management

When you discover important information about this project:

1. **Update CLAUDE.md** if it's a permanent project rule or pattern
2. **Use Cursor's memory** for user preferences and session-specific learnings
3. **Create a session state file** (`.dev/<TASK>_SESSION_STATE.md`) for multi-step tasks

### What to Remember

- Project-specific conventions discovered during work
- User preferences for code style or workflow
- Patterns that prevent repeated mistakes
- Corrections to existing knowledge

### What NOT to Remember

- Credentials, tokens, or secrets
- Transient task details (use session files)
- Information already in CLAUDE.md

### Session Continuity

For large efforts (PR reviews, multi-step refactors):

1. Create `.dev/<TASK>_SESSION_STATE.md` using the template at `.dev/SESSION_STATE_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Update after each meaningful phase
3. Files matching `*_SESSION_STATE.md` are auto-ignored by `.gitignore`
